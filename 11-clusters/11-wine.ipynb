Nice balance between weighty fruit and clean acid kept the wine very alive . The finish remained tight throughout though . As with other 1999s that we had recently , I got a feeling with this wine that we had shook it awake from a deep slumber and that it remained rather grumpy and unforgiving for that .

From the standpoint that this wine is hard to get a hold of , it is an experience by itself . That the wine lived up to the expectations we had for it , was something special .

Tasted before and after some nice samplings by Lewis , Orin Swift etc ... and even that did n't help make this any more appealing .\",\n",
       " 'Palate of dark chocolate and licorice was full and nice but the wine was tannic and tight needing more air time than I allowed . Time in bottle will do it good .',\n",
       " 'An alright wine . nose is fruity with some flower components , however the taste lacking and does not back up the smell . Had with Crab , which went pretty well , but did not add to the meal , just was there , not competing , not annoying , just there .',\n",

       " 'Two different wines over the course of five hours - both excellent in their own way . Initially cranberyy and orange rind notes on the nose . Lighter body , red color and delicate on the palate . By the later stages , it got much darker , added weight and the dark fruit , chocolate and flint was more apparant . At all times the acidity gave it a nice freshness . Balanced .',\n",
       " \"i 've read that this is a decent QPR winery , so i wanted to try what they presented . this has all 5 bordeaux varietals according to the rep . plays it close to the vest , a bit cookie - cutter , but has a decent net value .\",\n",

No rough edges . This should age really well , but I could easily drink now . Parker gave this a 96 - 100 .',\n",

For $ 14.99 this is not a bad deal at all . I was expecting worse after reading some of the reviews . Second day not quite as firm in taste not the clean fruit that was there yesterday , either that or my palate has gone south after all the cycling today . This is definitely a pop & pour , is definitely worth another bottle or two .',\n",

Talk about luscious , this wine is huge with rich ripe berryfruit , chocolate , licorice , and blackcurrant . The tannins touch the palate with a velvet glove and gently glide through . The finish goes on forever with abundant ripe fruit .',\n",

       " 'The wine was very tannic after breathing for only a half hour . Lots of fruit on the tongue with cherries and rasberry standing out .

A wonderful palate of flowers , chocolate , dark berries and a small hint of vanilla . But , this wine is exceedingly young . It has a magnificent tannin structure to it , but one that suggests magnificence in tasting 5 - 10 years from now . It did relax over the 90 minutes we drank the bottle , but never really to the point where I was not dreaming into the future . It 's drinkable , but with a relatively high pucker factor .\",\n",

Initial nose of more wet earth and tasted a bit of black tea on the end .

Probably a little past its prime but still an interesting and enjoyable wine . 88 - 89pts\",\n",

       " 'Initial sweetness and fruit nicely framed by tannins that dio not overpower . Time in the glass brings the fruit front and center to this wine .

The palate is limp , with hints of what must once have been an enticing mouthful . Now , it 's boring , with just a touch of bitter chocolate to round out the scant fruit . Not much of a finish either . Very disappointed that I did not drink sooner . Edit:- I was just eating some grapes and happened to chew on a stem - it immediately reminded me of this wine . That is what it was - the palate tasted a little like the stems got into the juice . The tannins were bitter rather than fruity .\",\n",
